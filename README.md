# Beads Kanban UI

**See all your tasks at a glance. Organize, and track progress across projects - no CLI required.**

A beautiful visual Kanban board for the [Beads CLI](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) task tracker. Beads stores tasks as git-native files (`.beads/issues.jsonl`), and this UI gives you the dashboard and board you've been missing.

> **Works great with [Beads Orchestration](https://github.com/AvivK5498/Claude-Code-Beads-Orchestration)** — A multi-agent orchestration framework for Claude Code that uses beads for git-native task tracking.

## See It in Action

**Dashboard** — All your projects in one place with status at a glance:

**Kanban Board** — Organize tasks across Open → In Progress → In Review → Closed:

**Bead Details** — Dive into epics with full context and subtasks:

## What You Get

- **Multi-project dashboard** — Manage all your beads projects in one place with status donut charts
- **Kanban board** — Open → In Progress → In Review → Closed
- **Epic support** — Group related tasks, track progress with bars, view all subtasks
- **Real-time sync** — File watcher auto-updates when beads files change on disk
- **Git integration** — See branch status for each task at a glance
- **Search & filter** — Quick filters for status, priority, owner, and tags
- **Project tagging** — Organize with colored tags and filter by them

## Quick Start

### Option 1: npm install (Recommended)

**Prerequisites:**
- Beads CLI: `brew install steveyegge/beads/bd`

**Install and run:**
```bash
npm install -g beads-ui
bead-kanban
```

That's it! The server starts automatically and opens your browser.

> On first run, the postinstall script downloads the platform binary (~15MB). This is one-time only.

### Option 2: Build from source

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
# Install beads CLI
brew install steveyegge/beads/bd

# You'll also need Node.js 18+ and Rust
```

**Install and run:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AvivK5498/beads-kanban-ui
cd beads-kanban-ui
npm install
npm run dev:full
```

Then navigate to **`http://localhost:3007`** and add your beads projects.

The app watches for file changes and syncs in real-time.

## Detailed Setup

### Development Mode

Run both frontend and backend together:
```bash
npm run dev:full
```

Or run separately:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Frontend (http://localhost:3007)
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Backend (http://localhost:3008)
npm run server:dev
```

The Rust backend builds automatically on first run. If you need to rebuild it:
```bash
cd server && cargo build --release && cd ..
```

### Production Build

For a single binary deployment:
```bash
npm run build
npm run server:build
./server/target/release/beads-server
```

The production server embeds the frontend and serves everything from a single binary on port 3008.

## How It Works

### Dashboard
1. Click **+ Add Project** and select a directory with a `.beads/` folder
2. See all projects with status donuts showing task distribution
3. Click any project to view its Kanban board

### Kanban Board
1. Tasks are organized by status: Open, In Progress, In Review, Closed
2. Drag cards between columns to update status
3. Click any task to see full details, comments, and related subtasks (for epics)

### Features in Detail

**Search & Filter**
- Quick filters for status, priority, and assigned owner
- Project tags for organization

**Real-time Sync**
- The app watches `.beads/issues.jsonl` and updates automatically
- No refresh needed—changes appear instantly

**Git Integration**
- Each task shows its git branch status
- Useful for tracking which branch a task lives on

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Rust with Axum framework
- **Database**: SQLite for project metadata
- **File Sync**: Real-time watcher for `.beads/` changes
